# Description

The goal of this repo is share with the community examples of how can you implement the Modular Monolithic architecture in the projects, this repo contains many examples in wroted in differents techonologies and frameworks, and also 
it contains from basic examples to more hard examples about the Moduluar Monolithic architecture.
But wait... What does Modular Monolithic architecture is? lets take a look....

## Modular Monolithic architecture.

it is an architecture style that break myth that the monolitics are bad and the best solution to integrate an agile and robust solution are the Microservices, basically from my experiencie the modular 
monolith can be a good solution to start thinking about "modularization" and segregation of a monolithic application, and it can be the first step to migrate from monolith application to distributed application.
